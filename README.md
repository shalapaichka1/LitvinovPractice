## Task 1
You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

Examples
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]


## Task 2
Bob is a lazy man.

He needs you to create a method that can determine how many letters (both uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters) and digits are in a given string.

Example:

"hel2!lo" --> 6

"wicked .. !" --> 6

"!?..A" --> 1

## Task 3
Implement a function center that takes a string strng, an integer width, and an optional character fill (default: ' ') and returns a new string of length width where strng is centered and on the right and left padded with fill.

## Task 4
You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

Examples
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

## Task 5
What is an anagram? Well, two words are anagrams of each other if they both contain the same letters. For example:

'abba' & 'baab' == true

'abba' & 'bbaa' == true

'abba' & 'abbba' == false

'abba' & 'abca' == false
Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list. You will be given two inputs a word and an array with words. You should return an array of all the anagrams or an empty array if there are none. For example:

anagrams('abba', ['aabb', 'abcd', 'bbaa', 'dada']) => ['aabb', 'bbaa']

anagrams('racer', ['crazer', 'carer', 'racar', 'caers', 'racer']) => ['carer', 'racer']

anagrams('laser', ['lazing', 'lazy',  'lacer']) => []
